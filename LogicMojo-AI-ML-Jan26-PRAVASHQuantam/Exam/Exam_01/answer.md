## Section B: Conceptual Questions

Answer any 4 questions. Each question carries 5 marks.

1. You are given product interaction logs with `customer_id`, `event_type`, `product_id`, `price`, `quantity`, and `is_returned`. Describe a pandas feature engineering pipeline that creates one row per customer using counts, revenue, return behavior, unique products, and conversion-rate style features.

2. A CNN trained on 28x28 grayscale images reaches 99% training accuracy but only 82% validation accuracy. Explain at least four likely causes or fixes.
- Answer:
- a) Applying Weight Decay (L2 Regularization) to reduce overfitting. 
- b) Early Stopping to stop training when validation performance stops improving. 
- c) Increasing Dropout to 0.5 to prevent memorization.
- d) Data Augmentation to improve generalization by creating more image variations.

3. Explain the difference between logits, probabilities, and predicted class labels in a multi-class PyTorch classifier. Include where `CrossEntropyLoss` fits in.

- Answer: 
Logits:- The raw outputs produced by the final layer of the neural network before applying softmax.
Probabilities:- Obtained by applying softmax to logits.
Predicted:- Classes with highest score --> preds = outputs.argmax(dim=1)
Computes loss directly from logits
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = loss_fn(logits, labels)

4. A medical image dataset has 5,000 normal samples and 300 disease-positive samples. Propose a training and evaluation strategy that handles imbalance responsibly.
- Answer: For an imbalanced dataset, I would use stratified splitting to maintain balance in the train and test split. During training, I would use techniques like weighted loss, balanced sampling, data augmentation, dropout, and early stopping to improve learning and reduce overfitting.

5. You are fine-tuning a pretrained CNN on a small custom dataset. Explain when you would freeze layers, when you would unfreeze layers, and how you would choose learning rates.
- Answer: I would first freeze early layers because they already learn general features like edges, textures, and shapes from large datasets such as ImageNet. Then I would train only the final classifier layer on the new dataset.
I would unfreeze some deeper layers if the new dataset is very different from the original dataset or if validation performance stops improving.
For learning rates:
I would use a higher learning rate for the new classifier head because it starts with random weights.
I would use a smaller learning rate for pretrained layers to avoid destroying previously learned useful features.
